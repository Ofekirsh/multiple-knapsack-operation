"""
Planning layer public API for the MKP pipeline.

This module exposes the core planning-time data contracts:
  - State models (SelectionState, RuntimeState, RuntimeKnapsack)
  - Policy configuration
  - Solution and PlacementDecision models

Other planning modules (phase1, phase2, solvers, tracker, cli) are intentionally
not exported here to avoid cluttering the namespace. They should be imported
explicitly when needed.
